## Why Carbon

- **API-first**: Carbon apps are built with a single API that you have access to
- **Full-stack type safety**: Backend and frontend code are co-located for type-safe simplicity
- **Integrated agents**: Built-in MCP client/server implementation with permissioned clients
- **Manufacturing-focused**: Built for the complexity of complex assembly and make-to-order parts workflows across multiple locations

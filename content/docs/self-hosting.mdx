Single-click self-hosting is coming soon! 

For now, please include the required by environment variables found in [env.ts](https://github.com/crbnos/carbon/blob/main/packages/auth/src/config/env.ts), and setup the following infrastructure:

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
- [Upstash](https://upstash.com)
- [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev)
- [Resend](https://resend.com) (Email service)
- [Novu](https://novu.co) (In-app notifications)

If you need help self-hosting Carbon in a GovCloud environment, please [contact us](https://carbon.ms/sales).

## Email Service (Resend)

Resend is used for transactional emails including user invitations, email verification, and onboarding.

1. [Create a Resend account](https://resend.com)
2. Configure the following environment variables:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` - Your API key (format: `re_**********`)
   - `RESEND_DOMAIN` - Your domain for sending emails (no trailing slashes or protocols)
   - `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID` - Optional, required for contact management in background jobs

These variables are used in the authentication configuration (`packages/auth/src/config/env.ts`).

## In-App Notifications (Novu)

Novu is used for in-app notifications and notification workflows throughout the application.

1. [Create a Novu account](https://novu.co)
2. Configure the following environment variables:
   - `NOVU_APPLICATION_ID` - Client-side public identifier (format: `********************`)
   - `NOVU_SECRET_KEY` - Server-side secret key, backend only (format: `********************`)

3. After setup, sync your Novu workflows with the Carbon application:
   ```bash
   npm run novu:sync
   ```
   
   This command syncs your Novu workflows using the bridge URL.

## Vercel Configuration

Carbon is designed to be hosted on Vercel. In order to the ERP and MES apps, you will need to create a new Vercel project for each app with the following configurations and required environment variables:

### `/apps/erp/`
